 While working on this lab, as suggested by the given PDF we divided our filing 
 system into three primary layers: the DFS at the top, the dbuffercache in the 
 middle, and the virtual disk at the bottom.  The constants class specifies various 
 aspects of the program, including number of blocks, the size of the blocks, the 
 size of the inodes, max file size, and max number of files.

 DFS

 The implementation of our DFS consists of two primary classes: MyDFS (which 
 implements the DFS interface given to us from the source code) and DFile.  The 
 DFile class represents an actual file in our filing system and encapsulates all 
 of the data associated with a given file (name/ID number, list of disk blocks 
 associated with the file, the size of the file, number of readers and the number 
 of writers).  The class also implements the details of dealing with multiple 
 threads attempting to read and write to the same file by utilizing synchronized 
 methods to incorporate locking.  If a thread attempts to read the file while 
 there are still writers or pending writes, the thread waits.  Similarly, if a 
 thread attempts to write to a file while there are other threads reading it or 
 waiting to read it, the thread waits.  Any time a thread releases the lock 
 associated with the file, notifyAll() is called to wake up any waiting readers or 
 writers. We assign waiting writers priority due to the fact that threads don't 
 want to read the old information. The MyDFS class holds information regarding 
 the state of the entire filing system (allocated and freed blocks, map associating fileID number with the 
 actual file in the system, an instantiation of the dbuffcache) and is the entry 
 point into the file system.  Every test program starts by calling DFS.init(), 
 which instantiates a dbuffcache and a virtual disk.  It then grabs block 0 from 
 the dbuffcache, which is where information would go to determine if the VDS is valid.
 Then, the inode blocks are scanned in from the dbuffcache and files are recreated from the 
 information stored in the inodes.  All the necessary state stored in the DFS 
 class is updated as well.  The DFS class also implements all the necessary 
 methods create, destroy, read, and write dfiles.  To create a file, the DFS makes 
 a new DFileID object with the lowest available file ID number, allocates a block 
 to that file, creates the file, updates the fileIDMap, and then loads it into the 
 dbuffcache.  To destroy a file, the allocated blocks associated with the file are 
 added back to the free list, and the inode is then updated so that it changes its
 size to 0.  In order to read a file, the DFS loops through the 
 blocks associated with that file in the map, gets a DBuffer for each block, and 
 reads the data into a byte array while dealing with acquiring and releasing of 
 the read lock.  To write to a file, the DFS allocates more blocks to the file to 
 fit any more data that needs to be written, gets a DBuffer for each block, writes 
 the given byte array to the blocks and then releases the blocks to be used 
 later.  We also implemented private methods that create inodes for files and can 
 instantiate a file from an inode.

 DBufferCache

 The cache layer is implemented in two primary classes: MyDBuffer and 
 MyDBufferCache.  MyDBuffer represents a cache block in the simulated I/O cache 
 that stores data from disk and stores the state of the cache blocks (whether or 
 not it is busy, clean, and valid, the actual data itself).  The MyDBuffer has 
 methods implemented to fetch a block from disk, push dirty blocks to disk, and 
 read and write data to the buffer itself.  In order to read, threads wait until 
 the data associated with the block is valid, reads, and then reads and releases the
 block.  To write, threads copy the information, and then release the block.  
 MyDBufferCache represents the actual cache itself, and stores a reference to the virtual disk, a 
 list of least recently used blocks, and a map of block numbers to actual 
 DBuffers.  The getBlock method in MyDBufferCache return a DBuffer object to the 
 DFS by accessing the map using the given blockID and if it is in the map, 
 returning the block and updating the LRU list.  If the associated block is not in 
 the map, the class checks to see if the cache is full, and if it is, removes the 
 LRU cache block which is not busy from the cache and creates a new block for 
 the associated data.  It makes sure to push any dirty changes before finishing.
 Reads and writes from threads are stored in the cache and dirty blocks are 
 written to the disk on a sync() call.

 VirtualDisk

 The third and lowest layer of our dfiler is the VirtualDisk, primarily 
 implemented in MyVirtualDisk along with the DiskRequest class.  The DiskRequest 
 class stores information regarding a given request for information from disk (the 
 associated DBuffer and whether it is a read or write to the file associated with 
 the buffer).  The primary data store in the MyVirtualDisk class is a queue of 
 DiskRequests.  The run() method of the class is synchronized with regards to the 
 requestqueue so that multiple threads are not reading and writing data to the 
 disk at the same time which could result in race conditions that would store bad 
 data.  If the requestqueue is empty, then the disk waits until a new request is 
 added to the queue which notifies it to wake up and continue running (like 
 producer consumer problem).  To process a request, the disk either reads or 
 writes to the associated Dbuffer and calls iocomplete on the buffer when finished 
 to let the buffer know that it is done.  All of these operations are 
 asynchronous.

 Generally a solid lab, difficult to understand at first but once we got a 
 solid grasp it was enjoyable building the filing system. It could be helpful
 to provide tests in the future as we found it difficult to build tests
 that hit every facet of the system.
